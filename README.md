MVC for C# training session.
This project I don't include `wwwroot` folder which contains static assets. You can have this folder when you generate a project with a new  mvc project with the command below.
```
dotnet new mvc
```
Make sure you have installed dotnet SDK. Copy `wwwroot` to my project in order to run.
To run the project, just use this command.
```
dotnet run
```

Enjoy.
